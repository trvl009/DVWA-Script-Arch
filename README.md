## 📖 Description

**This is a fork of [IamCarron's](https://github.com/IamCarron) [DVWA installer script](https://github.com/IamCarron/DVWA-Script) for Arch-based systems.**

This script automates the installation process for [DVWA (Damn Vulnerable Web Application)](https://github.com/digininja/DVWA), a web application intentionally designed to be vulnerable to various attacks. DVWA is a tool for learning and practicing web application security.

*This fork is currently under development.*
